# Qiskit Learning Repository

Welcome to our collaborative repository on **Quantum Computing using Qiskit**!  
This project is maintained by **Noor Fatima** and **Sir Ghulam Nabi**, where we aim to bridge the gap between **quantum computing theory** and **hands-on implementation** using Qiskit.

---

## 🌟 Project Goals

- 📘 **Explain how actual quantum hardware works**
- 🧠 **Dive into the backend operations of quantum circuits and gates**
- 💻 **Demonstrate how to run Qiskit code on both simulators and real quantum hardware**
- 📓 **Provide detailed notebooks combining theory with practical examples**
